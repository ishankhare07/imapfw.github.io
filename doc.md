# The Tao of imapfw

Here is the starting point to understand the global architecture about imapfw.

{:.note}
TIP: most of the file names are clickable.


## How the program boots

{:.note}
A top-down approach.

The Python file called from the command line is [`imapfw.py`]({{ sources }}/imapfw.py). Look at the imports:

{% highlight python %}
from imapfw import Imapfw
{% endhighlight %}

It first imports the [`imapfw` package]({{ sources }}/imapfw). As a good Python programer, you know that when importing a module of a package, Python first executes the `__init__.py` file(s) of this package (from high-level to down-level).

So here, it loads and executes [`imapfw/__init__.py`]({{ sources }}/imapfw/__init__.py). In this file, we have:

{% highlight python %}
from imapfw.init import Imapfw
{% endhighlight %}

Since `init` is in the same package, we can check this [`imapfw/init.py`]({{ sources }}/imapfw/init.py) out. Bingo! We have the starting code. Reading this file, you should figure that its job is to:

* initialize the environment;
* load and run the action requested at CLI.


## The components of the imapfw package

The modules and sub-packages in [`imapfw`]({{ sources }}/imapfw):

* **actions/** \\
Package of all the available actions at CLI. Each action is only picking the required ressources it needs.
* **annotation.py** \\
The Python3 annotations used in the codebase.
* **api/** \\
The exposed API. The purpose is to make proper indirection of the real code to allow higher flexibility and a better organization. Used in the `rascal`.
* **architects/** \\
Internal library to factorize code dedicated to the art of architecturing. This provides predefined environements/architectures handling workers, communication between workers, etc.
* **concurrency/** \\
Package providing concurrency.
* **conf/** \\
Package about configuring the runtime environement. Also, enables access to the CLI options.
* **constants.py** \\
Where to store the constants.
* **controllers/** \\
Controllers available, to be used on top of a driver.
* **drivers/** \\
Low-level to manipulate data of a repository (Maildir, IMAP, etc).
* **edmp.py** \\
Event-driven message passing: communication between workers.
* **engines/** \\
Engines allow to apply some processing logic to the connected end-point(s) (e.g.: synchronization).
* **error.py** \\
Exceptions used in imapfw.
* **imap/** \\
Handles the IMAP protocol.
* **interface.py** \\
Allow to check the internal/public interfaces. Reinforce unit testing and legacy compatibility.
* **offlineimap/** \\
Internal package dedicated to the `offlineimap` action.
* **rascal.py** \\
Package to access the rascal. The rascal is the "configuration file" defined by the user. The framework will use objects and call functions defined here.
* **runners/** \\
A runner is the function to call in a worker. Simple runners *(not likelly to change)* are put here.
* **runtime.py** \\
Module to handle global variables.
* **shells/** \\
Package dedicated to the `shell` action.
* **testing/** \\
Package dedicated to the `unittests` action.
* **toolkit.py** \\
Some factorized features that not worth a dedicated module.
* **types/** \\
The high-level types imapfw is working with (messages, repositories, accounts, etc). Expect them to be used by advanced users from the rascal.
* **ui/** \\
Package for the user interface.
